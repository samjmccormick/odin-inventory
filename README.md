1. populate postgreSQL database from rest API
2. then CRUD data using SQL queries
3. write it initially on local database before deploying to railway
4. for views need grid view of all data with ability to filter by categories
5. need view for individual item
6. view for adding data (form), updating data (form)
7. delete should just be button
8. ability to delete entire categories?
9. should probably have a button to repopulate database with initial data (reset)
10. not sure if it's easiest to initially fully populate pokemon database from api, or to do it piecemiel and only add values when searched and added by user
11. I guess it probably is slower in the beginning but then faster after that
12. need to figure out the async handler

1. populate postgreSQL database from rest API
2. then CRUD data using SQL queries
3. write it initially on local database before deploying to railway
4. for views need grid view of all data with ability to filter by categories
5. need view for individual item
6. view for adding data (form), updating data (form)
7. delete should just be button
8. ability to delete entire categories?
9. should probably have a button to repopulate database with initial data (reset)
